                <p><strong>Feijoada</strong> is a traditional <strong>Brazilian</strong> dish that is a favorite among
                    locals and <br>
                    tourists alike. Typically made with black beans, various cuts of pork, and <br>
                    spices, resulting in a flavorful and satisfying meal. It's often served with <br>
                    rice, farofa (toasted manioc flour), and orange slices to balance out the <br>
                    richness of the dish. Feijoada is more than just a meal, it's a cultural experience.</p>
